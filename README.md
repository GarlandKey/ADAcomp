# ADAcomp
This app is an aid to reduce the amount of paperwork and time required to perform an ADA compliance inspection. This app increased productivity by 50%, with about 4 hours saved per inspection.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `ReactJS` `NodeJS` `ExpressJS` `MongoDB` `Mongoose`

I started by building a detailed prototype using Figma. The I broke down the prototype into logical components to be worked on. From there, I started building the controllers, models, router, and REST API using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB & Mongoose. Then I started building out the view using ReactJS.

## Optimizations

When the MVP was complete, I noticed some inefficiencies in the API that needed to be adjusted. I was storing information in the database that wasn't necessary and could be handled directly by the server. The result was a major decrease in data transfer to and from the database which saved money for the client.

In the near future, I will be porting this to iOS and Android with the help of React Native.

## Lessons Learned

The process of taking on so many roles to design and develop this product on my own taught me that it's important to have structure and to thoroughly think things through and map out the work before you start writing code. If I had not done this, the quality of my product and the time invested would have suffered greatly.
